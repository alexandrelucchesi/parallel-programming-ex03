Signal Propagation

When orterun receives a SIGTERM and SIGINT, it will attempt to kill the entire
job by sending all processes in the job a SIGTERM, waiting a small number of
seconds, then sending all processes in the job a SIGKILL.

SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals received by orterun are propagated to all processes in the job.

One can turn on forwarding of SIGSTOP and SIGCONT to the program executed by
mpirun by setting the MCA  parameter  orte_forward_job_control to 1. A
SIGTSTOP signal to mpirun will then cause a SIGSTOP signal to be sent to all
of the programs started by mpirun and likewise a SIGCONT signal to mpirun will
cause a SIGCONT sent.

Other signals are not currently propagated by orterun.
